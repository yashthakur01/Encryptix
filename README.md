Second Project

Third Project

Python-Contact-book-application
This is a Contact List program I created using Python with tkinter module and SQLite3 database. Includes ability to add, edit, delete a contact with their names, email, phone number and address. Names are automatically sorted by last name of contact. Contacts are referenced by unique ID to avoid conflicts with contacts with same names.
